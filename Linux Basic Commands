-------- Necessary Signs --------

~$ means root directory
/$ means user directory

-------- Commands ----------

>> uname (user name)
>> uname --help (to see al available feature of it)
>> history (to know which commands you have used earlier)
>> cd .. (backtrack to the previous folder [catch directory])
>> touch newFile.txt (to create new file)
>> rm newFile.txt (to remove the newFile.txt)
>> mkdir newDirectory (to make a new directory/folder)
>> rmdir newDirectroy (to remove a directory)
>> ls -l fileName (to show the permission of any file)
>> chmod 673 fileName (to change the permission status of fileName)
>> chmod -x fileName (to make fileName executable)
>> grep keyword fileName (to search the keyword in fileName)
>> grep --text picoCTF static (here --text means converting the binary file to text file and seach the picoCTF word in 'static' file)


-------- Necessary Terminologies --------

Code for changing permission of any file: 

Code 	Nmemonics
----	---------
1 	execute
2 	write
4 	read

now for example:
You want to assign
admin - rw
group - rwx
public - wx

then the equivalent code would be

admin - 4+2=6
group - 1+2+4=7
public - 2+1=3



------------- CTF Tricks ------------------

* Press Tab button multiple time to get deeper into the file hierarchy (means directory -> subdirectory -> subdirectory -> ....) 

* For converting between number base use the following commands:
	> echo 'ibase=16; obase=2; 70' | bc 	( this commands convert a Hexadecimal number to Binary number
	> echo 'ibase=16; 70' | bc 		(this commands convert a Hexadecimal number to Decimal number and this decimal conversion is more 							recommended than that of previous one)
	
* nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 41120 ( here jupiter.... is a server name and 41120 is the port number. using nc we connect the server using port)

* You have to learn about converting number betweeen different bases (https://hackthematrixforlife.wordpress.com/houseplant2020-ctf-writeup/)
