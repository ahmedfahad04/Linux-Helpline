1. gcc/g++ is not working

-> This might not work when you run any C++ program initially, but for C programs it should act as alright. You should run the following commands:

	> sudo apt-get install gcc
	> sudo apt-get install g++
	> sudo apt-get install build-essential
	
Then its recommended to restart and your pc and check again that if gcc/g++ is perfectly installed or not by these commands:

	> gcc --version
	> g++ --version
