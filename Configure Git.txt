# Configure git in Ubuntu:
Step - 1: Run the following command on terminal to install git in your system
		
		$ sudo apt update
		$ sudo apt install git
		$ git --version
		
if it prints something like this "git version 2.33.0" it means installation done.

Step - 2: Run the following command on terminal to set up ssh connection with your github accout
		
		$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
		# just press enter to save the file in default location
		# then simply add a passphrase(i.e. password) to confirm
		
		$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
		$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
		$ ssh -T git@github.com
		# here you will be asked "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?", you should type onlye "yes"
		
		
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install xclip
		# Downloads and installs xclip. If you don't have `apt-get`, you might need to use another installer (like `yum`)

		$ xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
		# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
		
ssh key generation done. In next step you will just need to add the key to your github accoutn
